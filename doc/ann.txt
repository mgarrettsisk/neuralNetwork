Outline for ANN:


Create an ANN with the following parameters:
	3 layers:
		4 input neurons (with 1 bias neuron)
		1 hidden neuron (with 0 bias neurons)
		2 output neurons (with 0 bias neurons)

FEED FORWARD: 

	Input Layer is a column vector of size 5, the weights are a single row matrix of 5.

	Compute the product of the two matrices, feed it into the sigmoid function, then you have the activation.

	This activation is then multiplied into a two row, single column matrix, the resulting values are then put into the sigmoid activation.

	The result is the answer, a_1 = dark, a_2 = light

BACK PROPAGATION:

	Compute the error
